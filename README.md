Building a simple shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, I've learnt about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

To use this make sure you have cmake installed on your setup
then run the bash command 
"./your_program.sh"
to run the shell
You can also include a path in this command
